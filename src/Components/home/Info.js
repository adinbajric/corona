              Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild
              to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring
              special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical
              problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
              respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious
              illness.

            The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well
            informed about the COVID-19 virus.
            <div className="textBrake">
              Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands
              or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your
              face. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of
              saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs
              or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory
              etiquette.
